Even in the limited sense in which the concept has traditionally been understood in ordinary and in legal discourse, the principal-agent relation is a phenomenon of significant scope and economic magnitude. But economic theory has recently recognized that analogous interactions are virtually universal in the economy, at least as one significant component of almost all transactions.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   ;Arrow's work likely involves the economic and decision-making aspects of agency, exploring how individuals make choices and influence outcomes.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               ;American                                                                                                                                                ;Economics                                         ;2014 ;Exploring implicit and explicit aspects of sense of agency                                                                                                               ;na                                                                      ;Agency                                                                   ;0

We are working to develop a fundamentally different view by answering two questions: Do biological mechanisms allow organisms to be active agents in the construction of their own novel, adaptive features and resilience to challenges? How might a scientific theory of agency be built, since existing theories treat organisms as objects?                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                ;                                                                                                                                                        ;Philosophy, Zoology                               ;2009 ;An online neural substrate for sense of agency                                                                                                                           ;na                                                                      ;Agency                                                                   ;0

Theoretical/Academic Implications: This study explores the boundary conditions of traditional agency theory in the hope of extending agency theory outside its current contextual boundaries. In doing so, we provide a more robust and exhaustive view of the economic exchange between principals and agents. Practitioner/Policy Implications: This study offers insights to managers about how intrinsic incentives may provide an alternative mechanism of control over agents' behavior to extrinsic incentives prescribed by traditional agency theory. Indeed, intrinsic incentives of personal satisfaction and identification with organizational objects, combined with implicit social obligations and reciprocity may, under certain circumstances, provide stronger restraints on agent opportunism than the use of traditional extrinsic rewards in the form of incentive alignment. ;https://asu.elsevierpure.com/en/publications/has-agency-theory-run-its-course-making-the-theory-more-flexible-                                          ;Economics                                         ;2015 ;Having control over the external world increases the implicit sense of agency                                                                                            ;10.1111/corg.12004                                                      ;Agency                                                                   ;https://asu.elsevierpure.com/en/publications/has-agency-theory-run-its-course-making-the-theory-more-flexible-

We will say that an agency relationship has arisen between two (or more) parties when one, designated as the agent, acts for, on behalf of, or as representative for the other, designated the principal, in a particular domain of decision problems. Examples of agency are universal. Essentially all contractural arrangements, as between employer and employee or the state and the governed, for example, contain important elements of agency. In addition, without explicitly studying the agency relationship, much of the economic literature on problems of moral hazard (see K. J. Arrow) is concerned with problems raised by agency.

Radner) or of financial intermediaries in monetary models is also an example of agency theory.                                                                                                                                                                   ;Ross' work likely involves the economic and decision-making aspects of agency, exploring how individuals make choices and influence outcomes.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 ;USA                                                                                                                                                     ;Economics                                         ;1973 ;Action control and the sense of agency                                                                                                                                   ;https://www.aeaweb.org/aer/top20/63.2.134-139.pdf                       ;Agency                                                                   ;:https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/The-Economic-Theory-of-Agency%3A-The-Principal%27s-Ross/fcc14e6e3ca7f9b7f6cbe09b4e05712905527e47
